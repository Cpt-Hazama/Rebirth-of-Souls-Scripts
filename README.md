## PZZE Decompression
Used to decompress files with PZZE compression (can verify with a hex editor by looking for 'PZZE' in the header)

## Audio Name Patch
Used to repair the names of extracted WAV files to the original names prior to being compiled in Wwise. Note that this currently only works for voice lines (and maybe sfx?), I will add music support later but I'd like to play the game now lol
