## PZZE Decompression
Used to decompress TACTPKG files (seems to contain animation data from what I can see)

## Audio Name Patch
Used to repair the names of extracted WAV files to the original names prior to being compiled in Wwise. Note that is currently only works for voice lines (and maybe sfx?), I will add music support later but I'd like to play the game now lol
